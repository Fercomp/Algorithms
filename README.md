# About This Repository

This repository documents my journey of learning algorithms and data structures, which I began in my final year of college in mid-2025. The goal was to create a personal knowledge base of solved problems with clear, detailed documentation. This allows me to revisit and reinforce key concepts whenever needed.

# Why Python?

My first attempt at this project was with C++. However, I found myself spending more time wrestling with the complexities of the language than focusing on the algorithms themselves. Frustrated, I set the project aside.

Years later, I decided to try again with Python. Its clean syntax and "syntactic sugar" allowed me to concentrate on problem-solving logic rather than language-specific details. My plan is to eventually return to these problems with C++, as I believe there is value in understanding lower-level implementations.

## Repository Structure

* **`/learning`**: Contains foundational problems organized by topic (e.g., matrices, graphs, linked lists). These were the first exercises I tackled for each subject, making them a good starting point for beginners. The problems are compiled from various online sources.

* **`/halim`**: Features my solutions to problems from the book *Competitive Programming* by Steven and Felix Halim. This collection uses the UVa Online Judge problem set and is an excellent resource for competitive programming practice.

## Recommended Learning Resources

These are the primary resources that have guided my studies:

* **[GeeksforGeeks DSA Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/dsa-tutorial-learn-data-structures-and-algorithms/)**: An excellent platform with a logical progression from simple to very difficult problems, most of which are well-explained.

* **[takeUforward (YouTube Channel)](https://www.youtube.com/@takeUforward)**: This channel was a game-changer for me when I started. The detailed, step-by-step explanations are fantastic for learners at any level. What's truly amazing is that he offers all of this for free. I'm immensely grateful for his dedication and feel a huge debt of gratitude for his work.
